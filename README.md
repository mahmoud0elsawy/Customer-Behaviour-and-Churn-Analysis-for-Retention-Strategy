# 💼 Customer Behaviour and Churn Analysis for Retention Strategy

## 📋 Project Overview
This project investigates customer behavior patterns with a focus on **churn analysis**, **engagement metrics**, and **demographic factors**.  
It identifies key churn drivers such as **location**, **push notification status**, and **credit card saving behavior**, providing actionable insights to enhance customer loyalty and retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure overall customer churn rate.  
- Identify demographic and behavioral factors affecting churn.  
- Explore how engagement tools (push notifications, saved payments) impact retention.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer experience.

## 📊 Key Findings
| Category | Insight |
|-----------|----------|
| 📉 **Overall Churn Rate** | 14% churned, 86% retained — small percentage but high financial impact. |
| 🌍 **Churn by Location** | Location **415** showed the highest churn (~1,650). |
| 🔔 **Push Notifications** | Opted-in users churned far less (~1,000 vs. 2,400). |
| 💳 **Credit Card Saved** | Saving card info drastically lowers churn (~300 vs. 3,300). |
| 📈 **Numeric Distributions** | Skewed variables indicate need for preprocessing before modeling. |

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Regional Campaigns**  
   - Investigate churn-heavy regions (e.g., Location 415).  
   - Launch localized offers and service improvements.

2. **Push Notification Optimization**  
   - Encourage opt-ins and personalize notifications to boost engagement.

3. **Credit Card Incentives**  
   - Offer rewards or faster checkout for customers who save payment info.

4. **Data Preparation for Modeling**  
   - Normalize numeric variables for better churn prediction performance.
